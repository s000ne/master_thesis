% This dissertation was written under the supervision of Professor Dragomir Nenchev.
% His precise orientation and meaningful remarks lead me to this rewarding research to tackle
% to the Reaction Null-Space based control method for free-floating/flying space manipulators.

% First, the author would like to thank Professor Nenchev for providing me some interesting and precious experiences,
% especially presentation in an international conference,
% writing master thesis in English and so on.
% During the master course, I could tackle several issues in robotics field,
% such as reactionless motion control of space robots, motion/force control for fixed-base redundant manipulators,
% whole body control of humanoid robot and multi-body dynamics.
% It is also thanks to the Professor's proposals.

% Associated Professor Sato gave me exact comments to improve my research,
% especially in the Robotics Seminar.
% And also thanks to Assoc.\ Prof.\ Sato, the Japanese papers that I wrote could become better quality.

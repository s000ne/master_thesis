This dissertation was written under the supervision of Professor Dragomir Nenchev.
His precise orientation and meaningful remarks lead me to this rewarding research to tackle
to the Reaction Null-Space based control method for free-floating/flying space manipulators.

First, the author would like to thank Professor Nenchev for providing me some interesting and precious experiences,
especially presentation in an international conference,
writing master thesis in English and so on.
During the master course, I could tackle several issues in robotics field,
such as reactionless motion control of space robots, motion/force control for fixed-base redundant manipulators,
whole body control of humanoid robot and multi-body dynamics.
It is also thanks to the Professor's proposals.

Associated Professor Sato gave me exact comments to improve my research,
especially in the Robotics Seminar.
His advice made the Japanese papers that I wrote better quality.
